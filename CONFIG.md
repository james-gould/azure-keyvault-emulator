# Configuring your local system for the Emulator

> [!NOTE]
> You only need to do this once, assuming you don't delete your certificates locally!

The Azure SDK enforces `SSL` which requires a Trusted Root CA Authority on your local machine - this is unavoidable but easy to solve.

Due to this being a security requirement you may have access constraints on your machine; **this documentation is brief** but to make it easy to navigate use the table of contents below to navigate it a bit easier:

    2. [(Optional) Granular Configuration](#aspire-config)
2. [Manual Without Docker](#local-docker)
    1. [Installing Manual Certificates](#installing-certificates)
3. [FAQ](#FAQ)

## Using Aspire

To make this as frictionless as possible the `AzureKeyVaultEmulator.Aspire.Hosting` library can automate **all** of this process for you in the background.

After initial launch and installation the `Hosting` library will detect the certificates on your machine and not attempt to generate or install them again.

If you're unable to run your IDE (or a terminal) as `Administrator` you will need to use the [manual SSL instructions.](#local-docker)

### Automatic SSL

To generate and install the certificates automatically simply run your IDE as `Administrator`; this is required due to Root Trust Store installation needing elevated priviledges. If you're using the `dotnet` CLI you will need to be running your terminal as `Administrator`.

Once the initial run has been done without errors, you **no longer** need to run your application (or IDE) as `Administrator`. 

If you don't want to configure the container you're finished ðŸŽ‰! Everything will work as intended and you never need to read these docs again, feel free to restart your IDE/terminal without `Administrator` and use the Emulator to your heart's content.

### Aspire Config

The following configuration changes how the `AzureKeyVaultEmulator.Aspire.Hosting` library behaves:

- `LocalCertificatePath (string)`: Instructs the local path of the SSL certificates. Defaults to `""`.
    - If unset/null your local user directory will be used, ie on Windows this is `C:/Users/Name/` with the certificates placed in `keyvaultemulator/certs` for the full path of `C:/Users/Name/keyvaultemulator/certs`.
- `ShouldGenerateCertificates (bool)`: Attempt to create the SSL certificates. Defaults to `true`.
- `LoadCertificatesIntoTrustStore (bool)`: Attempt installation of the certificates, requires admin rights. Defaults to `true`.
- `ForceCleanupOnShutdown (bool)`: Attempt to delete SSL certificates at `LocalCertificatePath` on shutdown. This is unstable and shouldn't be relied upon. Defaults to `false`.
- `Lifetime (ContainerLifetime)`: Sets the `ContainerLifetime` of the Emulator. There are 2 available values:
    - `Session`: The default option. On shutdown `destroy` the container.
    - `Persistent`: On shutdown turn off the Emulator container, but do not `destroy` it.
    - These options do not interfere with the SSL certificates.

There are two ways to utilise this configuration, **all of them are optional** and will default to allow automatic SSL on your machine.

With `User Secrets` you can create a configuration section with the following options:

```json
{
  "KeyVaultEmulator": {
    "LocalCertificatePath": "C:/Users/MyName/keyvaultemulator/certs",
    "LoadCertificatesIntoTrustStore": false,
    "ShouldGenerateCertificates": false,
    "ForceCleanupOnShutdown": false,
    "Lifetime": "Persistent"
  }
}
```

which then can be used like:

```cs
var keyVault = builder
    .AddAzureKeyVault("myLocalKeyVault)
    .RunAsEmulator(configSectionName: "KeyVaultEmulator");
```

> [!NOTE]
> The section name `KeyVaultEmulator` can be whatever you like.

Or you can pass in the same values directly as an `object`:

```cs
    var keyVault = builder
    .AddAzureKeyVault(AspireConstants.EmulatorServiceName)
    .RunAsEmulator(new KeyVaultEmulatorOptions
    {
        ForceCleanupOnShutdown = false,
        Lifetime = ContainerLifetime.Persistent,
        LoadCertificatesIntoTrustStore = true,
        LocalCertificatePath = "C:/temp/kve/certs",
        ShouldGenerateCertificates = true
    });
```

If you run into SSL Connection issues, ie `UntrustedRoot`, your configuration is incorrect or the certificates in your specified directory aren't installed on your machine.

## Local Docker

> [!NOTE]
> If you're unable to run your IDE or terminal as `Administrator` when using `.NET Aspire` you need to follow the below instructions, but can skip the *mount that directory...* bullet point. [You must also specify the directory containing your certificates to the Emulator](#aspire-config).

You do not need to use `.NET Aspire` to run the emulator, but you will have to generate the certificates yourself.

- First read and finish the [certificate generation instructions](https://github.com/james-gould/azure-keyvault-emulator/blob/development/certificateutilities/README.md) to prepare the certificates (3 minutes).
- Follow the *Installing Certificates* section below to insert them into your host machine's Root Trust Store.
- Place the generated files, `emulator.pfx` and `emulator.crt` into a directory that is unlikely to be accidentally deleted. 
    - Your local user directory is recommended, on Windows this would be `C:/User/Name`, with the certs placed in `keyvaultemulator/certs` for the full path of `C:/Users/Name/keyvaultemulator/certs`.
- Mount that directory as a `volume` to `certs/` when you start the container so the certificates can be installed into the API.
    - For Docker this would be using the `-v C:/Users/Name/keyvaultemulator/certs:certs/:ro`.

### Installing Certificates

The certificates must be installed as a **Trusted Root CA** to achieve SSL:

- On Windows install `emulator.pfx`.
    - Right click -> Install and follow the wizard.
- Otherwise install `emulator.crt`.
    - `Linux`: Run `cp emulator.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/emulator.crt && update-ca-certificates`
    - MacOS: Run `sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain <path to your certificates>`

## FAQ

> Is this safe?

Yes. It's no different than the `SSL` constraints of developing `ASP.NET Core` applications locally, or trying to use a non-existing domain/DNS with `HTTPS`.  The only other viable option was for a real domain to be purchased with valid SSL and requiring users to edit their `hosts` file to map `localhost` to `<perm domain>` which was out of the question.

> Do I need to do this every time I want to use the Emulator?

No. You only need to do this once, unless you uninstall and delete the certificates. If you remove them from your local machine you will need to repeat this process **once**, and then never again. Unless you remove them from your local machine... you get the idea.

> I can't elevate my machine to `Administrator` or manually install `SSL` certificates. What now?

You will unfortunately be unable to use the Azure Key Vault Emulator with the Azure Client SDK. 

You can still use the container's REST API providing you disable SSL validation, which mimics the real [Azure Key Vault REST API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/keyvault/).

> Is this required? Can we just use `HTTP`?

Yes, it's required, and unfortunately we can't use HTTP. The Azure Client SDK enforces `HTTPS` (and thus SSL certificates) when checking the `vaultUri`. Without the certificates installed as trusted the connections from the SDK into the Emulator will timeout and throw an exception due to `UntrustedRoot`.

> I followed the documentation and still can't get a trusted connection to work. What next?

If you're validating the requests using your browser please restart it. You will need to fully close *all* instances, not just the tab/window you're looking at. If that still doesn't help please [raise an issue](https://github.com/james-gould/azure-keyvault-emulator/issues) and I'll support with high priority.
