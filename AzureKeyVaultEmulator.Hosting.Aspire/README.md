# Overview

Provides the ability to emulate the `AzureKeyVault` Aspire resource using the open source [emulator](https://github.com/james-gould/azure-keyvault-emulator).

Recommended, but not required, is the [client library](https://google.com) to make using the emulator in your applications incredibly simple.

# Usage

Install the package to your .NET Aspire `AppHost` project:

`dotnet install nuget link`

Next you can either redirect an existing `AzureKeyVaultResource` to use the emulator, or directly include it without needing any Azure configuration.

To redirect a hosted key vault:

```csharp
var keyVaultServiceName = "keyvault";

var keyVault = builder
    .AddAzureKeyVault(keyVaultServiceName)
    .RunAsEmulator(); // Add this line

    var webApi = builder
    .AddProject<Projects.MyApi>("api")
    .WithReference(keyvault); // reference as normal
```

> [!WARNING]
> This will still attempt to provision resources (or confirm they already exist), at runtime your connection string will be a `localhost` URL. 

To use directly without needing to set up any Azure configuration:

```csharp
var keyVaultServiceName = "keyvault";

var keyVault = builder.AddAzureKeyVaultEmulator(keyVaultServiceName);
```

You will then have a feature complete, emulated `Azure Key Vault` running locally:
